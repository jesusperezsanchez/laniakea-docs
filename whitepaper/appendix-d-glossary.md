## Stability

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ALM** | Asset Liability Management — liquidity and portfolio rules that support the USDS peg |
| **ASC** | Actively Stabilizing Collateral — highly liquid non‑USDS assets used to buy USDS during downward peg pressure |
| **DAB** | Demand Absorption Buffer — highly liquid USDS (or USDS-equivalent) positions used to sell USDS during upward peg pressure |

## Treasury

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
